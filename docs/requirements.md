BASIC APP
This is the simplest version of the app I can picture.

Users
  - Standard login, logout, forgot password functionality
  - Admin Users (Spye)
    - Create/Edit/Remove: users, slideshows, slides and blocks
  - Client Users
    - Edit: their own slideshows
    - Create/Edit/remove: slides and blocks
  - Users can own multiple slideshows but cannot access others slideshows

Slideshow
  - Overall resolution can be set to accomadate a variety of display setups (i.e. gaps between displays)
  - Number of screens can be set and configured
  - Slideshows have a styling area accessible only to Spye allowing blocks to be customized for that slideshow.     Customizations here are done with code.

Slides
- Slides can belong to a single slideshow
- Slides can have a full screen video background that stretches across all screens
- Slides have a duration
- Each slide has a content area for each screen
- Content areas can hold various types of blocks

Blocks
- Each content area can have one block
- A block represents a content type

Block

  A title, subtitle and content area.

  A title, subtitle and scrolling list area. List items have their own title, subtitle and content.
